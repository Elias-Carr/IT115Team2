        Linux was original created in 1991 by the Finnish developer Linus Torvalds, with Version 1.0 of the Linux kernel in 1994. 
		Linux was created as freeware to be a UNIX-like operating system. GNU, a collection of free software and UNIX-like OS, 
		was publicly started by Richard Stallman in 1983, later being added to the Linux kernel around 1992 to create GNU/Lunix. 
		Linuxâ€™s popularity and usage grew in the 1990s due to it being a collaborative effort of many volunteer developers around 
		the world. Different types of Linux (known as distributions) were created starting in the 90s and are still being developed 
		and upkept to this day. Linux is the primary OS preferred by developers and is the backbone of almost all servers. 
		Many different types of computers are reliant on Linux, with cellphones and supercomputers being some of the most widely 
		used machines running Linux. Even large companies use their own modified versions of the Linux kernel. 
		Android and Google phones, as well as the Chrome OS and even modern macOS use their own form of Linux. 
		Nowadays, Linux is the most used operating system in the world, even more used than the ever-popular Windows, 
		all thanks to the collaboration of like-minded developers.
