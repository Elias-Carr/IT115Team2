When a programming language is described as “low-level” or “high-level”, it is referring to the level of abstraction between the programming language and the computer’s instruction set architecture. In other words, how far removed is the programming language from the functions and commands that the computer understands? What level of transformation needs to occur to the programming language in order for the computer to process it?
<BR><BR>
Low-level programming languages are structurally similar to the computer’s existing functions and commands and require little to no interpreting or compiling in order to be processed. They are efficient and use less memory but are more difficult for humans to understand and use.
<BR><BR>
High-level programming languages are designed for ease of use and contain various elements that are more intuitive and readable by humans. This does require interpreting and compiling in order for the computer to process it. Additionally, they are less efficient and use more memory, which is referred to as the “abstraction penalty”.
