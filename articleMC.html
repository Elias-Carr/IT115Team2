<p>These days, with all our personal data online, we must be aware of the various ways our data can be compromised. The following are a few of those ways, and what can be done to mitigate the damage. <br>
1. Computer Viruses and other Malware: Though less common these days, one must always use caution when downloading software onto a device. Always double check the URL of websites you visit for downloads and the sender of any emails before downloading attachments. <br>
2. Passwords: Using a weak password or the same password for multiple logins is risky. Always use uniquely generated passwords and a password manager to keep track of them. Two-factor authentication is another option to consider. <br>
3. Phishing: Be wary of emails or text messages from untrusted senders. Phishing is a way to trick people into giving their information by posing as an official from a company or organization. Always double check URLs before clicking on them. <br>
4. Up-to-date Software: Out of date software can give your devices vulnerabilities that might be difficult to see. Always keep your devices and software up-to-date with the latest patches. </p>
