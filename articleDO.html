At the time, they were developing a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair 8800, one of the earliest personal computers. This humble beginning marked the start of Microsoft's journey to become one of the world's leading technology companies. The garage, where the company began, is now considered a historic site, and the success of Microsoft has had a profound impact on the technology industry." onmouseover="showAlt(this)" onmouseout="hideAlt(this)">

		<q>	Microsoft Windows, a computer operating system developed by Microsoft Corporation, has undergone nine major versions since its 1985 inception. Starting with Windows 1, which introduced a graphical user interface (GUI) with mouse support, subsequent versions like Windows 2 (1987) brought overlapping windows, and Windows 3 (1990) achieved widespread success with multitasking and 256 colors. Windows 95 (1995) featured the Start button and "plug and play," while Windows XP (2001) unified consumer and enterprise elements. Windows 7 (2009) addressed issues, and Windows 8 (2012) introduced a touch-friendly interface. Windows 10 (2015) aimed for platform unification, featuring a Start menu and regular updates, marking Microsoft's decision to end large-scale revisions. Running on about 90% of PCs, Windows has evolved from a GUI extension of MS-DOS to a dominant force in the PC market, offering improved functionality and interface enhancements across its various iterations.</q>
