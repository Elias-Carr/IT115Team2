At the time, they were developing a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair 8800, one of the earliest personal computers. This humble beginning marked the start of Microsoft's journey to become one of the world's leading technology companies. The garage, where the company began, is now considered a historic site, and the success of Microsoft has had a profound impact on the technology industry." onmouseover="showAlt(this)" onmouseout="hideAlt(this)">
