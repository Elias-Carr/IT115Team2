	<!--Mission Statement-->
	<p1>Microsoft Corporation’s success as a global company is founded on the fulfillment of its corporate mission and vision statements. The corporate mission statement presents the business purpose and a general idea of the technology business’s strategic approach to satisfying the corporate vision statement. In this sense, Microsoft’s corporate mission specifies what the business aims to do to increase customers’ success. On the other hand, the vision statement directs the development of the computer technology business toward a desired future condition. Currently, Microsoft’s corporate vision includes what the business can do for individual and organizational customers. Also, the corporate mission is strongly aligned with the corporate vision statement. This alignment is essential to optimizing strategic decisions, especially in addressing the competitive force from multinational firms like Apple, Google, Amazon, and IBM. As the Five Forces analysis of Microsoft Corporation indicates the strong force of competitive rivalry involving these firms, the company implements its corporate mission and vision statements to strengthen its competitive advantages.</p1>
